# Nutrition_App_iOS

I am working on a Swift Fitness & Nutrition application for my capstone project at Sheridan College as part of the Software Development and Network Engineering program.  Users will be able to enter what they ate and what kind of exercise they completed to get a solid picture of their overall fitness and nutrition over time.

For now with the prototype you can enter what the user is eating.  Get the micronutrient data using a robust nutrient API, store the caloric consuming data on a cloud database and visualize it to see how nutrient rich your diet is using various types of graphs.

Lots of work to be done over the summer, this is just the beginning! :)  The nutrition and fitness bit is only one part of a bigger application! Expected completion date - December 2018
