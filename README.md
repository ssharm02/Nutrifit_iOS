# Nutrition_App_iOS

I am working on a Swift Fitness & Nutrition application for my capstone project.  Users will be able to enter what they ate and what kind of exercise they completed to get a solid picture of their overall fitness and nutrition over time.

For now with the prototype you can enter what the user is eating.  Get the micronutrient data using a robust nutrient API, store the caloric consuming data on a cloud database and visualize it to see how nutrient rich your diet is.

Lots of work to be done over the summer, this is just the beginning! :)  The nutrition and fitness bit is only one part of a bigger application!  My team members: Navpreet Kaur, Jeanice Nguyen and Luis Ortiz are working various other aspects of the application.    Expected completion date - December 2018
