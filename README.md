# Nutrition_App_iOS

I really enjoyed working with Xcode and Swift.  I wanted to do a lot more with this application, including keeping track of calories, recommending diets and more.  However team wanted to work on something else and sadly we had to return our Macbooks at the end of the semester.  :/

Tech Used: Swift 4.1, Google Firebase, Alamofire, SwiftyJSON, Charts.  Developed in under 2 months and then abandoned
