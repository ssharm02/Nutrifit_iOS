# Nutrition_App_iOS

I am working on a Swift Fitness and nutrition application for my capstone project.  Users will be able to enter what they ate and what kind of exercise they completed to get a solid picture of their overall fitness and nutrition over time.

For now with the prototype you can enter what the user is eating.  Get the micronutrient data using a robust nutrient API, store the caloric consuming data on a cloud database and visualize it to see how nutrient rich your diet is.

Lots of work to be done over the summer, this is just the beginning! :)
