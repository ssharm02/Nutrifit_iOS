# Nutrition_App_iOS

I really enjoyed working with Xcode and Swift.  I wanted to do a lot more with this application, including keeping track of calories, recommending diets and more.  However team wanted to work on something else and sadly we had to return our Macbooks at the end of the semester.  :/

TODO Refactor code, implement Realm Swift, have model/interface for JSON Object being returned from API

Tech Used: Swift 4.1, Google Firebase, Alamofire, SwiftyJSON, Charts.  NOTE: I removed the project API keys and the large pod installs.
